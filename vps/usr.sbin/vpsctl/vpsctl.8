.Sh DESCRIPTION
.\" The following commands should be uncommented and
.\" used where appropriate.
The
.Nm
utility is used to manage Virtual Private System (VPS) instances,
e.g. starting, stopping, migrating and reading status information.
.Pp
Basically VPS works in a hierarchical way, so you can use the
.Nm
utility on the main host system (which in turn is a VPS instance too)
and inside child VPS instances as well. You can only see and manage
instances that are children of the current instance.
.Pp
For a general description of what VPS is, see
.Xr vps 4 .
.Pp
The following commands are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.\" 
.\" START
.It Cm start Ar id Op Ar config-file
Creates and runs a new VPS instance named
.Ar id
using settings from
.Ar config-file .
.Pp
If no
.Ar config-file
is given,
.Nm
tries to read settings from /etc/vps/vps_<ID>.conf.
.Pp
See the
.Sx FILES
sections for the config file syntax.
.\" 
.\" STOP
.It Cm stop Ar id Op Ar config-file
Stops and destroys VPS instance
.Ar id .
.Pp
If no
.Ar config-file
is given,
.Nm
tries to read settings from /etc/vps/vps_<ID>.conf.
.Pp
If you perform 'shutdown -h ...' from inside a VPS instance,
you still have to run
.Cm stop Ar id
to free it entirely.
.\" 
.\" LIST
.It Cm list
Prints a listing of all currently existing VPS instances.
Status is one of running, suspended or dead.
After stopping an instance, it may reside for a while as dead
instance in the system. A typical cause is TCP sockets in TIME_WAIT state.
After all references are gone, it will be automatically deleted.
.\".Pp
.\"Restore count tells you how often one instance was restored either from a
.\"snapshot file or in a live migration from another host.
.\"
.\" SHOW
.It Cm show Ar id
Shows some details about the VPS instance given by
.Ar id .
For a more detailed listing including all run-time properties about
a VPS instance see
.Cm argshow
.Ar id .
.\" 
.\" SHELL
.It Cm shell Ar id
Allocates a pseudo tty and starts an interactive shell in the given VPS instance.
This command is equally to 'vpsctl execwt /bin/sh'.
.\" 
.\" CONSOLE
.It Cm console Ar id
Opens the system console of the given VPS instance.
.\" 
.\" IFMOVE
.It Cm ifmove Ar id Ar ifname Op Ar ifnewname
Moves network interface
.Ar ifname
into vps instance
.Ar id
and optionally renames it to
.Op Ar ifnewname .
.\" 
.\" EXECIN
.It Cm execin Ar id Ar command Op Ar arguments ...
Starts the given
.Ar command
using
.Ar arguments
if given in the context of VPS instance
.Ar id .
The
.Nm
utility does not wait on exit of
.Ar command
but exits immediately.
.\" 
.\" EXECWT
.It Cm execwt Ar id Ar command Op Ar arguments ...
Same syntax as for the
.Cm execin
command, but a pseudo tty is allocated for
.Ar command
in order to have interactive input/output
and the
.Nm
utility waits until exit of
.Ar command .
.\" 
.\" EXECWT
.It Cm suspend Ar id
Suspends all processes in VPS instance
.Ar id ,
all TCP sockets are set to drop incoming data, every other activity is suspended.
May be used for creating consistent backups of one VPS instances' filesystem space.
.\" 
.\" RESUME
.It Cm resume Ar id
Resumes previously suspended vps instance
.Ar id .
.\" 
.\" SNAPSHOT
.It Cm snapshot Ar id Ar output-file
Writes a snapshot of
.Ar id
to
.Ar output-file ,
including the state of all processes, sockets, network attributes etc.
The VPS instance
.Ar id
has to be suspended by
.Cm suspend
first.
.\" 
.\" ABORT
.It Cm abort Ar id
Ungracefully kill all processes in VPS instance
.Ar id .
You still have to run
.Cm stop Ar id
to get rid of it.
If
.Ar id
is currently suspended, run
.Cm resume Ar id
afterwards in order to have effect.
.\" 
.\" RESTORE
.It Cm restore Ar id Ar input-file
Restores a VPS instance from a snapshot file previously created by
.Cm snapshot
to a suspended state. Use
.Cm resume Ar id
to get it running again.
.Pp
The snapshot file can originate from a different host, but care has
to be taken to have compatible or better, the same kernel, on both
systems. Before the actual restore process starts, sanity and compatibility
checks against the snapshot file are performed, but in case of mismatches
a kernel crash could still happen.
.Pp
Instead of
.Ar id
an empty string ('') can be given. The
.Ar id
the instance had when its snapshot was created is used then.
.Pp
The right instance config file has to exist.
.\" 
.\" MIGRATE
.It Cm migrate Ar id Ar remote-host Op Ar norsync|onersync
Performs a live migration of VPS instance
.Ar id
to host
.Ar remote-host .
All processes, open files, pipes, sockets, TCP session etc. are preserved.
.Pp
Specify
.Ar norsync
if you don't want the filesystem tree to be synced.
Do not use this option unless you are sure nothing was modified
or the filesystem is mounted readonly.
Specify
.Ar onersync
if you only need one sync pass (faster than two-pass but vps is suspended
longer).
.Pp
If the migration process fails or is aborted, the instance is left in
suspended state.
Use 
.Cm resume Ar id
to get it running again. You might have to set some network settings
in the parent system manually, like published arp entries and routes.
.Pp
SSH is used as transport to
.Ar remote-host .
If no ssh key is loaded/available, you will be prompted for a password.
.\"
.\" ARGSHOW
.It Cm argshow Ar id
Shows arguments of VPS instance
.Ar id .
.Pp
The output show IPv4 and IPv6 networks the instance is allowed to use
on its interfaces, as well as a list of privileges 
.Xr priv 9.
For
.Ar NOSYS
privileges, a 'No such system call' error is returned instead 
of 'Permission denied'. Some applications wouldn't run otherwise.
.Pp
Resource limits are shown as: resource type, current utilization,
preconfigured soft limit (may be exceeded if resources are still
available), hard limit (will never be exceeded) and counters how
often the soft or hard limits have been hit.
.\"
.\" IPNET ADD
.It Cm ipnet Ar id Cm add Ar address/network, ...
Adds an IP address or network to the list of networks the VPS
instance is allowed to use on its interfaces.
.Pp
Following formats are valid:
.Dl 192.168.123.231
.Dl 192.168.213.0/255.255.255.0
.Dl fc00::200:20
.Dl fc00::100:0/112
.Pp
Multiple networks can be specified on the command line at once,
separated by ',' but without whitespace.
.Pp
To specify networks in a configuration file, use 
.Ar IP_NETWORKS.
.\"
.\" IPNET REM
.It Cm ipnet Ar id Cm rem Ar address/network, ...
Removes a previously added IP address or network from the list.
See the description of
.Cm ipnet Ar id Cm add
for more information.
.\"
.\" PRIV ALLOW
.It Cm priv Ar id Cm allow Ar privilege-number, ...
Adds one or more privileges, specified by name (e.g. PRIV_KLD_LOAD)
or its numeric value, to the list of allowed privileges.
Separate multiple privileges by ',' without whitespace.
.Pp
See 
.Xr priv 9
for more information about privileges, and
.Ar sys/priv.h
for a list of defined privileges.
.Pp
To specify privileges in a configuration file, use
.Ar PRIV_ALLOW.
.\"
.\" PRIV DENY
.It Cm priv Ar id Cm deny Ar privilege-number, ...
Removes one or more privileges, specified by name (e.g. PRIV_KLD_LOAD)
or its numeric value, from the list of allowed or 'nosys' privileges.
.Pp
System calls or other operations that depend on the privilege in
question, return to userspace with a 'Permission denied' error.
.\"
.\" PRIV NOSYS
.It Cm priv Ar id Cm nosys privilege-number, ...
Adds one ore more privileges, specified by name (e.g. PRIV_KLD_LOAD)
or its numeric value, to the list of
privileges, that are not allowed, but supposed to return ''No such
system call'' instead of ''Permission denied'', to satisfy some
applications.
.Pp
To specify privileges in a configuration file, use
.Ar PRIV_NOSYS.
.\"
.\" LIMIT
.It Cm limit Ar id Ar resource:softlimit:hardlimit, ....
Configures a limit on one or more given resources (like virtual memory,
 cpu utilization, ...).
.Pp
The command
.Cm argshow
.Ar id
shows you which resources are known.
.Pp
The
.Ar softlimit
is a treshold that will be exceeded in case the current
utilization of the given resource allows to do so without affecting
other VPS instances' performance.
.Pp
The
.Ar hardlimit
will never be exceeded.
.Pp
For CPU utilization 'sysctl kern.fscale' equals 100% of one cpu
(To allow a VPS instance to use 25% of one CPU set the limit to
(sysctl kern.fscale) * 0.25).
.Pp
To specify resource limits in a configuration file, use
.Ar LIMITS .
.Pp
.\"
.\" SHOWDUMP
.It Cm showdump Ar file
Shows information about the snapshot contained in
.Ar file .
It generates a lot of output.

Example of a minimal VPS instance config file (/etc/vps/vps_testvps.conf):
.Pp
.Dl NAME = testvps
.Dl FSROOT = /vps/testvps
.Dl NETIF_0_ADDRESS = '1.2.3.4, 2001:2002::2003'
.Dl ROOT_MOUNT = 'true'
.Dl ROOT_UMOUNT = 'true'
.Dl INIT = '/sbin/init'
.Pp
See
.Xr vps.conf 5
for a complete description of config file options.
.Pp
The /vps/testvps directory contains a full FreeBSD userland installation.
See
.Xr jail 8
for examples how to install into a directory.
.Pp
The only crucial configuration bits are setting all terminals to
.Ar off
in
.Ar /etc/ttys ,
as well as putting
.Ar root_rw_mount=NO
into
.Ar /etc/rc.conf .
.Pp
Don't use nullfs, there are some issues with snapshot/restore.
.Pp
The IP addresses given are assumed to belong to a subnet on a physically attached
ethernet network. The
.Nm
utility
creates a published ARP entry and a local route for each address.
.Pp
Start the vps instance:
.Pp
.Dl vpsctl start testvps
.Dl vpsctl list
