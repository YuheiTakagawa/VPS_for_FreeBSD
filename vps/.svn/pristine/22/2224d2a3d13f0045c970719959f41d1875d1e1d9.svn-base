Your previously installed kernel has been moved to
/boot/kernel.GENERIC

Type:
boot /boot/kernel.GENERIC/kernel
at the boot loader prompt to use it.

There is an example config file at 
/etc/vps/vps_example.conf

A script that loads the kernel modules is at
/etc/rc.vpssetup.sh

See vpsctl(8) how to get started.
